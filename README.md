## **COVID-19 Vaccination Rate Analysis**

### Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to gain insight into what factors impact COVID-19 vaccination rates for New York City residents. 

### Research Question
Are there certain demographic factors (e.g., household income, population density) that predict vaccination rates of New York City residents?

### Design
* Features: Demographics - **ML or Database team to add**
* Target: Vaccination Rates

### Machine Learning Model
* **Model**: For our initial model, we are using a deep learning model to predict the COVID-19 vaccination rates of New York City residents. The neural network model behaves like a regression model, where a dependant output variable (vaccination rates) can be predicted from independent input variables (demographic information). 
* **Training**: The initial model uses X neurons and 3 layers including the output layer. The first two layers use the ReLU function. The output layer uses the linear activation function to predict the vaccination rates. The data was split into 80% training and 20% testing data and trained for 100 epochs. 
* **Accuracy**: The initial model's accuracy is X and the loss (mean squared error) is Y.
