For the NYS Vaccination Demographics by county were pulled at the following website
https://coronavirus.health.ny.gov/demographic-vaccination-data
Unfortunately there is no way to pull the data. No links to view/export data and it does not get picked up via power query so i manually pulled the table for this file.
Pulled 10/29/30
